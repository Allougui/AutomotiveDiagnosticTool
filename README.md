Main Scenario:
The project aims to streamline the diagnostic process, provide valuable insights, and foster collaboration between automotive service providers and end-users.
Sub-Scenario (B2B Services):
The B2B services involve authentication and authorization of service providers, allowing them secure access to diagnostic tools and collaborative features.
Implementation Steps:
Authentication and Authorization:
Implement JWT authentication and authorization in your Diagnostic Controller to secure access to diagnostic tools.
Set up roles and permissions to control access based on the user's role (e.g., "Admin" role for service providers).
Diagnostic Tools Endpoints:
Implement API endpoints for retrieving basic and detailed diagnostic information.
Secure these endpoints with the [Authorize] attribute to require authentication.
Collaboration Endpoints:
As part of B2B services, implement API endpoints for collaboration features (e.g., case sharing).
Secure these endpoints with appropriate authorization (e.g., [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")] for service providers).
Testing and Documentation:
Use tools like Postman or Swagger to test your API endpoints, ensuring they work as expected.
Update or create documentation to explain the purpose and usage of each endpoint.

Backend API Project - Diagnostic Performance
Overview
The Backend API Project for Diagnostic Performance is a .NET Core web application that serves as the backend for the Diagnostic Performance web interface. It handles requests from the frontend, performs diagnostic operations, and manages authentication and authorization.
Features
1. RESTful API Endpoints
•	Provides RESTful endpoints for basic and detailed diagnostic operations.
•	Supports user authentication to ensure secure access to diagnostic features.
2. SQLite Database
•	Utilizes an SQLite database for storing user information, diagnostic data, and authentication tokens.
•	The database is designed to be lightweight and easy to manage.
3. Token Authentication
•	Implements token-based authentication to secure API endpoints.
•	Generates and validates authentication tokens for user sessions.
Technologies Used
•	.NET Core: The backend is developed using the .NET Core framework, providing a cross-platform and scalable solution.
•	SQLite: A lightweight and embedded database used for data storage.
•	Entity Framework Core: Simplifies database interactions and data modeling.
Dependencies
•	Entity Framework Core: Manages database interactions and migrations.
•	IdentityServer4: Used for implementing token-based authentication.
•	Swagger: Provides API documentation for easier development and testing.
Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure with controllers, services, and data models. Key components include:
•	DiagnosticController: Defines API endpoints for diagnostic operations.
•	AuthenticationService: Manages user authentication and authorization.
•	SQLiteContext: Handles interactions with the SQLite database.


Frontend UI Project - Diagnostic Performance
Overview
The Frontend UI Project for Diagnostic Performance is a web application developed using Angular. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing diagnostic operations on a system. The application communicates with the backend server to execute basic and detailed diagnostic tasks, displaying the results to the user.
Features
1. Basic Diagnostic Operation
•	Users can initiate a basic diagnostic operation to check the system's status.
•	Successful and failed diagnostic results are displayed with relevant information.
2. Detailed Diagnostic Operation
•	Admin users can perform a detailed diagnostic operation for in-depth analysis.
•	The application fetches a B2B token before executing detailed diagnostics.
•	Results of detailed diagnostics, including success and failure messages, are displayed.
3. User Authentication
•	Users need to log in to access diagnostic features.
•	Admin privileges are required for detailed diagnostic operations.
Technologies Used
•	Angular: The frontend is built using the Angular framework, providing a modular and scalable structure.
•	HTML/CSS: Standard web technologies for creating a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
•	RxJS: Used for handling asynchronous operations, especially when dealing with HTTP requests.
Dependencies
•	Angular Material: Provides pre-built UI components for a consistent and modern look.
•	RxJS: Used for handling observables and asynchronous operations.
•	HttpClient: Angular's built-in module for making HTTP requests.
Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure with components, services, and modules for better maintainability. Key components include:
•	Diagnostic Component: Handles the initiation and display of diagnostic operations.
•	Token Service: Manages authentication tokens and B2B token fetching.
•	Diagnostic Service: Communicates with the backend server to perform diagnostics.
